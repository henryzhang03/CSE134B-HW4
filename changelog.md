# Changelog

### Changes
- Descriptions for my three projects
- A loader for when users navigate my pages
- Boxes around the skills and the images to represent the langauges
- Added a Youtube video with Embedly as the third party script. I added this because I believe that a proper full game from the largest competitive tournament in Fortnite history is worth more to the user to understand the game that I play than a small clip of me playing. I added the script correctly.
- Added shadow effect to Navbar for more style.
- Changed the short intro in the index.html file.
- Added hamburger menu for Navbar
- Added some icons for skills and additional skills.
